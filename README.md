This approach would aim to mimic the human brain's ability to understand, contextualize, and generate responses based on a complex web of semantic associations, emotional          contexts, and experiential learning.<br>

**Dynamic Semantic Understanding:**<br>
Just like the human brain, the NSW model would not only understand the literal meaning of words and phrases but also their context, connotations, and cultural significance. It     would dynamically adjust its understanding based on the context of the conversation or text.<br>

The NSW model employs a context-aware embedding layer, extending the transformer architecture with a dynamic attention mechanism that adjusts word embeddings based on their context within a sentence or a paragraph. This mechanism is trained using a combination of supervised learning on a large corpus of contextually annotated text and reinforcement learning with feedback from human evaluators.
